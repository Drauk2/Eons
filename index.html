                            Buddhism began over 2,500 years ago with a man named Siddhartha Gautama in ancient India. Born into a wealthy royal family, he lived a life of luxury, but he felt a deep sense of unease. He saw suffering everywhere—old age, sickness, and death—and decided to leave his palace to find a way to end this suffering. After years of wandering and searching, he sat under a Bodhi tree and meditated deeply until he achieved enlightenment, becoming the Buddha, which means "The Awakened One."
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-6">
                            He then spent the rest of his life teaching others what he had learned. His teachings spread across Asia, evolving and adapting to different cultures, leading to the many schools of Buddhism we see today. The first Buddhist community was formed by his followers, called the Sangha. This community helped to preserve his teachings, which were later written down as texts called Sutras.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From India, Buddhism traveled along ancient trade routes to places like Tibet, China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Each region added its own unique art, traditions, and styles of practice, creating a rich and diverse global tradition.

                            At the heart of Buddhist philosophy are the **Four Noble Truths**. They are a simple framework for understanding our experience of life.

                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 mb-6">
                            <li><strong class="text-[#A0522D]">The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha):</strong> Life involves suffering, dissatisfaction, and stress. This isn't just about big pain; it's also about the small frustrations we feel every day.</li>
                            <li><strong class="text-[#A0522D]">The Truth of the Cause of Suffering (Samudaya):</strong> The cause of our suffering is craving or attachment. We want things to be a certain way, and when they aren't, we feel upset.</li>
                            <li><strong class="text-[#A0522D]">The Truth of the End of Suffering (Nirodha):</strong> We can end suffering by letting go of craving and attachment.</li>
                            <li><strong class="text-[#A0522D]">The Truth of the Path to the End of Suffering (Magga):</strong> The way to let go is by following the **Eightfold Path**.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mb-6">
                            The **Eightfold Path** is a practical guide for daily life. It's not a set of strict rules, but rather a set of eight areas to work on. For example, "Right Mindfulness" encourages us to pay attention to our present moment without judgment. This can help you feel less stressed at work by focusing on one task at a time, or help you enjoy a meal more fully by noticing the flavors and smells instead of thinking about the past or future. "Right Speech" reminds us to use words that are helpful and kind, which can improve our relationships with others. By practicing these principles, we can find more peace and clarity in our daily routines.

                        Over time, Buddhism developed into different schools of thought. The two main branches are **Theravada** and **Mahayana**.

                    <p class="mb-6">
                        **Theravada** Buddhism is the oldest surviving school and is popular in countries like Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar. It focuses on the teachings of the Pali Canon and aims for individual enlightenment.

                    <p>
                        **Mahayana** Buddhism is practiced in places like China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. It emphasizes the goal of becoming a Bodhisattva—an enlightened being who chooses to stay and help all other beings reach enlightenment.

                            Meditation is a key practice in Buddhism for training the mind. A simple way to start is with mindfulness of breath.

                            <li>Take a few deep breaths, and then let your breathing return to its natural pace.</li>
                            <li>Focus your attention on the feeling of the breath entering and leaving your body. Notice the air going in and out of your nose, or the rise and fall of your belly.</li>
                            <li>Your mind will wander. This is normal. When you notice a thought, simply acknowledge it without judgment and gently bring your attention back to your breath.</li>
